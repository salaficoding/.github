# Salafi Coding Code of Conduct 🚧

As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh!

This Code of Conduct is currently under development 🛠️. We are working on a policy that reflects the values of the Qur’ān and Sunnah, rooted in respect, cooperation, and khayr (goodness) for the Ummah.

Once complete, this document will outline:

- Expected behavior in our GitHub repositories and community
- Unacceptable behavior and how to report it
- Our approach to resolving conflicts while maintaining brotherhood/sisterhood

In the meantime:

- Be kind, respectful, and patient
- Assume good intentions and always strive for clarity and khayr
- Let us all work together in a manner that pleases Allāh ﷻ

Jazākum Allāhu Khayran for your understanding.

Wa billāhi tawfīq.
