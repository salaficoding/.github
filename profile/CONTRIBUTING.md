# Contributing to Salafi Coding 🚧

As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh!

This contributing guide is currently under construction 🛠️. We are working on a clear and welcoming process that will, in shāʾ Allāh, allow developers, educators, and students to collaborate on Salafi Coding projects while maintaining our Islamic values and professional standards.

For now, here are a few things to keep in mind:

- All contributions must be in line with the values and mission of Salafi Coding.
- Please be respectful and professional when communicating with others.
- Avoid uploading any content that is non-halal or unrelated to educational purposes.
- If you see an issue, feel free to open an issue or pull request, but keep in mind that review may take time as we complete our guidelines.

We appreciate your patience and enthusiasm!

Jazākum Allāhu Khayran,
